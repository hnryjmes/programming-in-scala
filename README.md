*Third Edition, by Martin Odersky, Lex Spoon, Bill Venners*

`Notes by Henry Cooksley`

### 1 A Scalable Language

"The language is so named because it was designed to grow with the demands of its users."

#### 1.1 A language that grows on you

"Scala has a set of convenient constructs that help you get started quickly and let you program in a pleasantly concise style."

Growing new types

"Scala is much more like a bazaar than a cathedral, in the sense that it is designed to be extended and adapted by the people programming in it."
